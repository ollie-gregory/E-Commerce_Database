# E-Commerce Database

This repository contains all the files from an end-to-end database design and implementation for a hypothetical E-Commerce platform. The stages of development were as follows:

1. Conceptual modelling.
2. Relational modelling.
3. Synthetic Data Generation.
4. Database creation.
5. Trigger designs.
6. Implementation and testing.

The full report can be found on the repository website, along with in the Quarto markdown document `final_report.qmd`. This is where I have laid out the steps I took in designing and impelmenting the database, along with various SQL queries and trigger tests to ensure that it works as expected.
